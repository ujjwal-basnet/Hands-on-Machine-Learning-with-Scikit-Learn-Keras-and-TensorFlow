 r = n ∑ X Y − ∑ X ∑ Y ( n ∑ X 2 − ( ∑ X ) 2 ) ⋅ ( n ∑ Y 2 − ( ∑ Y ) 2 )
 we can calculate this by using .corr() method 

 -----------------------------------

it is used to measure linear relation-ship 


person corelation value range between 0 - 1 
-1 represents perfectly negatively linear relationship 
( as one variable increase another decrease )


0 indicated no linear relationship : no corelation betqn them 

+1 indicates . perfectly positive corelation  (meaning as one variable increase another also increase linearly )
